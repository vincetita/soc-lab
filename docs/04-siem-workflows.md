# SIEM Workflow (Security Onion)

## Analyst Workflow Overview
This lab follows a standard SOC process:

1. Detect
2. Triage
3. Hunt
4. Validate
5. Respond
6. Report

---

## Detection
- Alerts generated by Suricata
- Network telemetry from Zeek
- Aggregation in Elastic SIEM

---

## Triage (SOC UI)
- Open Alerts
- Filter by source IP:
  - 192.168.20.129 (Kali NAT)
  - 192.168.117.129 (Kali Host-Only)
- Identify scan, enumeration, or brute-force behavior

---

## Hunting
Use Hunt / Network views to pivot on:
- source.ip
- destination.ip
- destination.port
- uri
- user_agent

---

## Validation
- Match timestamps with Kali commands
- Confirm victim logs (Ubuntu auth.log)
- Review Zeek logs:
  - conn.log
  - http.log
  - tls.log
  - ssh.log

---

## Reporting
- Document activity
- Map to MITRE ATT&CK
- Save screenshots
- Create incident report markdown
