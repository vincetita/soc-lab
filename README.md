# soc-lab
End-to-end SOC lab using Security Onion, Kali, Ubuntu &amp; Windows — detection engineering, attack simulations, Sigma rules, dashboards, and SOAR workflows in VMware.

- Built segmented SIEM lab using Security Onion with realistic management vs monitoring planes

- Demonstrated full detection lifecycle: generate attack → detect → investigate → respond → report

- Produced evidence artifacts: terminal output, SOC alerts, Zeek telemetry, incident report

- Implemented SOAR-style response scripts: firewall block + fail2ban automation

- Mapped activity to MITRE ATT&CK and documented lessons learned
